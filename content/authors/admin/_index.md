I am currently PhD student at the [Institute of Environmental Geosciences](http://www.ige-grenoble.fr/?lang=en) (Grenoble, France), working on *[Modeling climate trends and variability in High Mountain Asia to understand cryosphere changes](project/phd/)* (supervised by Martin Ménégoz and [Gerhard Krinner](http://www.ige-grenoble.fr/-gerhard-krinner-)). We have a strong collaboration with the [IPSL](https://www.ipsl.fr/), using their [ORCHIDEE](https://orchidee.ipsl.fr/) and [LMDZ](https://lmdz.lmd.jussieu.fr/) models.
