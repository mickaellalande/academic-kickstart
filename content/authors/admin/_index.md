I’m currently a postdoc fellow at the [Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières (UQTR)](https://www.uqtr.ca/index.shtml) / [RIVE](https://oraprdnt.uqtr.uquebec.ca/pls/public/gscw031?owa_no_site=2137) / [GLACIOLAB](https://oraprdnt.uqtr.uquebec.ca/pls/public/gscw031?owa_no_site=5528) founded by the [ESA Climate Change Initiative](https://climate.esa.int/en/esa-climate/esa-cci/fellowships/) on “[Snow cover heterogeneity and its impact on the Climate and Carbon cycle of Arctic regions (SnowC<sup>2</sup>)](project/snowc2)” under the supervision of [Christophe Kinnard](https://oraprdnt.uqtr.uquebec.ca/pls/public/gscw045a.afficher_detail_form_reponse?owa_no_site=5528&owa_bottin=&owa_no_fiche=3&owa_no_form_reponse=221924&owa_apercu=N&owa_imprimable=N&owa_brouillon=N&owa_fenetre_surgissante=N&owa_lettre=%25&owa_no_page=1). The main objectives of this project are to improve the current snow model in [CLASSIC](https://cccma.gitlab.io/classic_pages/info/class/) and assess the influence of these new developments in the Arctic. 

Before that, I received my PhD at the [Institute of Environmental Geosciences](http://www.ige-grenoble.fr/?lang=en) (Grenoble, France) on “[Modeling climate trends and variability in High Mountain Asia to understand cryosphere changes](project/phd/)” supervised by [Martin Ménégoz](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=mouv8-IAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Gerhard Krinner](http://www.ige-grenoble.fr/-gerhard-krinner-), where I mainly focused on a [CMIP6 multimodel study](publication/phd/climate-change-in-the-high-mountain-asia-in-cmip6/) and on improving the representation of topography in snow cover parameterizations using the [ORCHIDEE](https://orchidee.ipsl.fr/) land surface model.
